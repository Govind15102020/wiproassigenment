Assignment 5: Craft a query using an INNER JOIN to combine 'orders' and 'customers' tables for customers in a specified region, and a LEFT JOIN to display all customers including those without orders.



To achieve this, we'll break the task into two parts:

Using an INNER JOIN to combine orders and customers tables for customers in a specified region.
Using a LEFT JOIN to display all customers, including those without orders.
Hereâ€™s how you can construct these queries:

Part 1: INNER JOIN for customers in a specified region
Assume the tables orders and customers have the following structure:

orders: order_id, customer_id, order_date, order_amount
customers: customer_id, customer_name, region
We will join these tables on customer_id and filter for customers in a specific region, say 'West'.

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    c.region,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    o.order_amount
FROM 
    customers c

INNER JOIN 
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE 
    c.region = 'West';
Part 2: LEFT JOIN to display all customers including those without orders
This query ensures that all customers are displayed, with null values for orders if there are no corresponding orders.

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    c.region,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    o.order_amount
FROM 
    customers c


LEFT JOIN 
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
Combining both parts together, the SQL queries would look like this:

Combined Queries
Query 1: INNER JOIN for customers in a specified region (e.g., 'West')
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    c.region,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    o.order_amount
FROM 
    customers c


INNER JOIN 
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE 
    c.region = 'West';
Query 2: LEFT JOIN to display all customers including those without orders
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    c.region,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    o.order_amount
FROM 
    customers c


LEFT JOIN 
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
