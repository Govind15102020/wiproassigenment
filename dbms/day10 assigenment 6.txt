Assignment 5: Craft a query using an INNER JOIN to combine 'orders' and 'customers' tables for customers in a specified region, and a LEFT JOIN to display all customers including those without orders.




Using an INNER JOIN to combine orders and customers tables for customers in a specified region.
Using a LEFT JOIN to display all customers, including those without orders.
Hereâ€™s how you can construct these queries:

Part 1: INNER JOIN for customers in a specified region
Assume the tables orders and customers have the following structure:

orders: order_id, customer_id, order_date, order_amount
customers: customer_id, customer_name, region
We will join these tables on customer_id and filter for customers in a specific region, say 'West'.

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    c.region,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    o.order_amount
FROM 
    customers c
INNER JOIN 
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE 
    c.region = 'West';
Part 2: LEFT JOIN to display all customers including those without orders
This query ensures that all customers are displayed, with null values for orders if there are no corresponding orders.

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    c.region,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    o.order_amount
FROM 
    customers c
LEFT JOIN 
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
Combining both parts together, the SQL queries would look like this:

Combined Queries
Query 1: INNER JOIN for customers in a specified region (e.g., 'West')
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    c.region,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    o.order_amount
FROM 
    customers c
INNER JOIN 
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE 
    c.region = 'West';
Query 2: LEFT JOIN to display all customers including those without orders
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    c.region,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    o.order_amount
FROM 
    customers c
LEFT JOIN 
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
These queries should fulfill the requirements for your assignment.

Assignment 6: Utilize a subquery to find customers who have placed orders above the average order value, and write a UNION query to combine two SELECT statements with the same number of columns.
ChatGPT
To complete Assignment 6, we'll tackle it in two parts:

Use a subquery to find customers who have placed orders above the average order value.
Write a UNION query to combine two SELECT statements with the same number of columns.
Part 1: Subquery to find customers who have placed orders above the average order value
Assuming the orders table has columns order_id, customer_id, and order_amount, we can first calculate the average order value, then use this in a subquery to find customers whose orders exceed this average.

Query:
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    order_id, 
    order_amount
FROM 
    orders
WHERE 
    order_amount > (SELECT AVG(order_amount) FROM orders);
Part 2: UNION query to combine two SELECT statements with the same number of columns
For the UNION query, we'll create two SELECT statements that retrieve data from the customers and orders tables. These SELECT statements must have the same number of columns and compatible data types.

Assume we want to combine a list of customers from a specific region with a list of customers who have placed orders above a certain amount.

Query:
sql
Copy code
-- First SELECT statement: Customers from the 'East' region
SELECT 
    c.customer_id, 
    c.customer_name, 
    'East' AS region
FROM 
    customers c
WHERE 
    c.region = 'East'

UNION

-- Second SELECT statement: Customers with orders above a certain amount (e.g., $1000)
SELECT 
    o.customer_id, 
    c.customer_name, 
    'High Order' AS region
FROM 
    orders o
JOIN 
    customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE 
    o.order_amount > 1000;
