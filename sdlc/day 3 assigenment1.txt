Day 3 - Assignment 1: Create an infographic illustrating the Test-Driven Development (TDD) process. Highlight steps like writing tests before code, benefits such as bug reduction, and how it fosters software reliability.


Test-Driven Development (TDD) Process
Steps:
Write a Test:

Write a test for a new feature or function.

                  Run the Test:

Run the test and see it fail (since the feature isnâ€™t implemented yet).

                  Write Code:

Write the minimum amount of code to make the test pass.

               Run the Test Again:
Run the test again and see it pass.

                       Refactor Code:
Refactor the code while ensuring all tests still pass.


                               Benefits:
Bug Reduction:
Helps identify and fix bugs early in the development process.
Software Reliability:
Ensures that the software behaves as expected and is reliable.
