day3 Assignment 2: Produce a comparative infographic of TDD, BDD, and FDD methodologies. Illustrate their unique approaches, benefits, and suitability for different software development contexts. Use visuals to enhance understanding.





Comparative Analysis of TDD, BDD, and FDD
Test-Driven Development (TDD)
       Approach:
Write tests before writing code.

            Benefits:
Bug reduction.
Improved software reliability.

           Suitability:
Best for projects where early bug detection is crucial.
Ensures that code changes do not break existing functionality.

        Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
Approach:
Write tests based on user behavior and scenarios.


Benefits:
Improved collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders.
Focuses on user-centric development.


Suitability:
Ideal for projects where user experience and behavior are critical.
Enhances communication and understanding among team members.
Feature-Driven Development (FDD)


Approach:
Develop features iteratively.
Focus on delivering client-valued features.

Benefits:
Efficient progress tracking.
Ensures timely delivery of high-priority features.


Suitability:
Suitable for larger projects where tracking feature progress is essential.
Helps in managing complex projects with clear milestones.
