To complete this assignment, let's start by defining what a typical home network topology might look like and how it can be configured to access an external environment like the RPS Lab. I'll provide a general example of a home network topology and then explain how you might access the RPS Lab environment from this setup.

Step 1: Home Network Topology Diagram
A home network topology typically includes the following components:

ISP Modem: Connects to the Internet Service Provider (ISP).
Router: Distributes the internet connection to multiple devices.
Switch (optional): Used if more Ethernet ports are needed.
Devices: Various devices like PCs, laptops, smartphones, tablets, and possibly other smart home devices.
Here's a basic diagram:

Step 2: Explanation of Home Network Components
ISP Modem: This device connects your home network to your ISP. It receives data from the ISP and converts it into a form that can be transmitted over your home network.

Router: The router connects to the modem and distributes the internet connection to all devices within the home network. It can do this wirelessly (Wi-Fi) or through wired connections (Ethernet).

Switch (optional): A network switch can be added if there are many wired devices in the home. It provides additional Ethernet ports.

Devices: These include any device that connects to the home network, such as PCs, laptops, smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and other IoT devices.

Step 3: Accessing the RPS Lab Environment
To access the RPS Lab environment from your home network, you typically need the following steps:

Internet Connection: Ensure your home network is connected to the internet via your ISP modem and router.

VPN (if required): If the RPS Lab environment requires secure access, you might need to connect to a VPN provided by your organization or institution. This will create a secure tunnel from your device to the RPS Lab network.

Remote Desktop/SSH (if applicable): Depending on the configuration, you might use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Secure Shell (SSH) to access the lab environment. This requires the RPS Lab to provide an IP address and login credentials.

Browser Access: Some lab environments are accessible via a web browser. You would use the provided URL to log in to the lab environment.

Example Steps to Access RPS Lab:
Connect to VPN:

Launch the VPN client on your device.
Enter your VPN credentials.
Connect to the VPN server.
Access Lab via Browser:

Open your web browser.
Enter the URL provided by the RPS Lab.
Log in with your credentials.
Access Lab via Remote Desktop:

Open the Remote Desktop application.
Enter the IP address of the RPS Lab environment.
Enter your login credentials.

The PC and Laptop connect to the internet through the router.
Both devices establish a VPN connection to securely access the RPS Lab.
Through the VPN, they access the RPS Lab environment either via a web browser or remote desktop, depending on the setup.
