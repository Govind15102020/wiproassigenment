3. Explain Absolute and Relative Path
Absolute Path:
An absolute path specifies a location from the root directory (/) and provides the complete path to the file or directory. It does not depend on the current working directory. An absolute path always starts with a /.

Example:

/home/user/Documents/file.txt
/var/log/syslog
Relative Path:
A relative path specifies a location relative to the current working directory. It does not start with a /, and it can use special symbols like . (current directory) and .. (parent directory) to navigate the file system.

Example:

Documents/file.txt (if the current working directory is /home/user)
../file.txt (refers to a file in the parent directory of the current working directory)
Using absolute paths ensures that you are specifying the exact location of a file or directory in the file system, while relative paths are useful for navigating within a directory structure without needing to specify the full path.
