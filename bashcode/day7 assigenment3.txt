 Write a script that reads numbers from the user until they

              enter '0'. The script should also print whether each number is odd or even.

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
    # Read a number from the user
    read -p "Enter a number (enter 0 to stop): " number
    
    # Check if the number is 0
    if [ "$number" -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Exiting..."
        break
    fi

    # Check if the number is odd or even
    if [ $((number % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "$number is even"
    else
        echo "$number is odd"
    fi
done
Save this script to a file, for example check_odd_even.sh, and make it executable with the following command:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x check_odd_even.sh
You can then run the script with:

bash
Copy code
./check_odd_even.s
